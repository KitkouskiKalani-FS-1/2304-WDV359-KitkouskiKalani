# Tech Stack


## Application Design

Bootstrap will be used for overall application design because it is something that I feel will have a positive influence to the design of my overall application.



## Front End Framework

React will be used because it is what I am most experienced in and could give the best end result for my portfolio due to my comfort with it.


## State Management

MongoDB will be used for managing data because of the scalability that mongo possesses. I plan to grow this project in the future so I want to be able to scale it easily with more potential columns of data and I think that would be most easily done using mongo.


## Node

Node is what I have experience with and feel most comfortable using.


## Express

Express is something I feel comfortable using but could definitely use more experience with so this should greatly increase my ability to utilize express.


## SQL/Postgres/Sequelize

Mongoose will be the ORM that I use for this project. It is one that I am familiar with the syntax and I can utilize it with MongoDB in node. I plan to use mongoose to make my models with validation.
