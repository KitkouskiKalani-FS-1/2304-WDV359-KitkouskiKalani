# Stats.gg

## Application Definition Statement

Stats.gg will be a statistic centric website that aims to create a platform where users can see tier lists, look at other players profiles and see the statistically sound item builds. This project will only be a website and we will not be transitioning to a mobile application so I we will be designed desktop first because it will be created for a desktop game.

## Target Market

*Using research, describe the people most likely to be utilizing your application. What are their ages, education level, employment sector, income level, hobbies, or any other defining characteristics that set them apart from other groups of people? Identifying specific groups will help drive application design choices.*

*Are there any secondary markets have many but not all overlapping defining characteristics that should be identified and design considerations be accommodated?*

My target audience would be Gamers who play League of Legends looking to find advantages through the use of statistics and data. There would be alot of variance in age, from early teens to early thirties. Education, employment, income would all vary. A largely consistent factor would be their hobbies would all involve gaming. The specific group I would be targetting would be gamers. I don't believe I would be looking for a different secondary market.

## User Profile

My ideal users would be people like me, people who have a hobby of playing League of Legends and want to take gain an advantage through the analysis of statistics. I am someone that uses these websites regularly so I know what people would and wouldn't like about them. I would want the design to be pretty mono-chromatic for the most part as I wouldn't want the colors to distract my users and I would use change in tones to highlight different areas that I users to be aware of rather than change the color entirely.

## Use Cases

As soon as they open the website they are at the dashboard I want all views to be reachable from a nav bar so that any single action can be made in as few clicks as possible. Most of my users would be looking at the champiom stats, time efficiency would be their top priority so having a larger nav bar to make it easier to navigate quickly would also be important.

## Problem Statement

Based on the research I have done I find that an issue people have is the fact there are many cool ideas that these stat websites have but people often time will use 2 or even 3 because some lack some of the options that others have. The area of the market I would want to fill is adding functionality that these websites have into one place and adding ideas that I think could give my audience value from my app.

## Pain Points

Pain points that my audience experience when using other similar products are the fact they have to use multiple of these websites and tab back and forth to crunch together a collaboration of 2-3 of these stat websites or lose out on valuable data if they only use one. Also user interface for most of these websites in my opinion could be greatly improved.

## Solution Statement

I am going to solve the problem by adding features that I feel are necessary from other competitors and also add my own ideas that I think would add value to my target audience's experience. I would also aim to provide a great user interface.

## Competition

A competing product that does a good job at doing this would be u.gg. They have a great user interface and have a fair amount of great tools in the same place. They also have a very easily navigable website that takes very few clicks to get to where you need to. However they are missing things like a multi-search, Basic Jungle routes, or even things such as a basic gameplan for each playable champion that could bring in value to a very large audience.

## Key Features

The user will have the ability to view a list of all of the Champions in League of Legends in a list.

The user will have the ability to click on any list item and go to a new page that displays more details about the champion.

The user will have the ability to search for a specific player on League of Legends and view information about that specific player.

This will serve the user by allowing them to have instant data on champions or a player as soon as they reach the site, I think a focus on speed would have them not have to log into the site like most other sites that are similar. However in the future the option may be added.

## Integrations

I would be using Riot Games League of Legends API to attain my data. All of my intended use complies with their Terms of Service.

## Change log

I will also be removing the feature to allow users to have the ability to see if a player is in-game. As well as see details about that match

The user will not have the ability to see junble clear routes or search for multiple players at once.

I had to remove all of these from the project as they would require an amount of time that would greatly exceed the 2 month requirement for the project.
