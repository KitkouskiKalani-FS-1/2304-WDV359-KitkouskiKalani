* The importance of clean code is that it can improve code quality, readability, and maintainability and it can actually save time in the long run.
* Better and DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself) code doesn't always mean shorter quality is always the priority.

* The Pareto principle can be used to prioritize tasks and business efforts by identifying the highest-impact tasks that will result in the most significant outcomes.

* A good README file is essential for a project, as it helps others understand what the code includes and why it's noteworthy.

**Note:**  

* My favorite resource was Understanding the Pareto principle (The 80/20 rule)
* I thought it was a very interesting concept of breaking down the important aspects of the project and putting full effort into those aspects of the project as they will net you the most reward.
