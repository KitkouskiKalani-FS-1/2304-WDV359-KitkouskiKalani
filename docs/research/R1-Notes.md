## Topic

This document contains general notes related to Project Initiation

<br>

## Sub-Topic 1
Getting Started

* That a communication plan should be created and that it is a means of deciding the frequency and means of communicating about a project.
* The process of initiating is explaining why the project is happening, who will be involved, what needs to be delivered and how and the timings to which the project will be delivered.
* The process of initiating can be boiled down to a summary, also known as Project Initiation Document(PID)

## Sub-Topic 2
Discovery: Can You Answer Software’s Key Kickoff Questions?

* Having a strategy for the project is essential and coding doesn't directly correlate to the completion of a project but planned coding does.
* Writing a list of objectives and ordering them in the order they should be done is a useful way to tackle problems within a project.
* Having ways to measure the success of a feature or the project itself need to be thought of prior to the release rather than after, they also need to be measurable.

## Sub-Topic 3
How to Get and Evaluate Startup Ideas

* The number 1 mistake among startups is not solving a real issue among users.
* The top 3 things that make a startup a good idea are:<br>
1) the idea is hard to get started<br>
2) the idea is in a boring space<br>
3) the idea has existing competitors<br>
* The best way to have good start up ideas is just look around and have them organically.
