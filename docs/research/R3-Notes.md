## Sub-Topic 1
The Ultimate Guide to A/B Testing

* A/B Testing is having two versions of an element and a metric that defines success in order to find which one is best for the real world.
* You need to find a tool to do A/B testing such as Google Website Optimizer.
* A conclusion from two separate A/B tests: putting human photos on a website increases conversion rates by as much as double. Scientific research backs this up, saying that we are subconsciously attracted to images with people.

## Sub-Topic 2
Use Case And Use Case Testing Complete Tutorial

* Use Case describes "How a system will respond to a given scenario". it is user oriented, not system oriented. Meaning we focus on the users perspective.
* When trying to write a case, the first question that should raise is "What’s the primary use for the customer?" This question will make you write your cases from the User’s perspective.
* Use Case testing in an application to find missing links, incomplete requirements, etc.

## Sub-Topic 3
Your First Plan

* The first step in creating an agile plan is creating a good list, the first element of that list is a Master Story, this story consists of the next 6 months of work written down in small chunks.
* This list should be labelled to have time investment for each chunk of work to be able to size up the project and define priorities.
* Picking dates to have things delivered by is important in order to make sure things even get shipped.
