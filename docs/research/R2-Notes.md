## Sub-Topic 1
What Is A SWOT Analysis?

* SWOT analysis is a business's strategic plan to evaluate its competitive position in the marketplace. Utilizing a SWOT analysis can give you an objective look at your product.
* In order to conduct an indepth and objective SWOT analysis you would have to answer questions on the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats to your product in the marketplace.
* There are alternatives to SWOT analysis that consist of SOAR, SCORE, NOISE and gap analysis. They all have specific pros and cons but SWOT is a great overview for your products potential success.

## Sub-Topic 2
OWASP Top Ten

* The number 1 OWASP security flaw is broken access control. This means proper user privelege is not given leading to unauthorized information being disclosed to people who shouldn't have it.
* The number 2 OWASP security flaw is sensitive data exposure. Meaning sensitive data was not successfully concealed. This would be data that is in clear text, such as sending tokens through the redirect url.
* The number 2 OWASP security flaw was one that was added by the commuity to be viewed as important. It is known as Server-side request forgery and is a web application flaw that happens when said application is fetching a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URL.

## Sub-Topic 3
About code scanning with CodeQL

* There are 3 ways to utilize CodeQL. Using the default setup, using advanced setup or run the CodeQL CLI directly.
* CodeQL allows you to find vulnerabilities in your code.
* The way CodeQL works is it generates a CodeQL database meant to represent your codebase. This CodeQL database is then queried to identify problems within the codebase.

**Note:**  

* My favorite resource was the OWASP Top Ten
* I thought it was really interesting looking at all the different vulnerabilities and how it adapts over time. The top 10 list had different placements and some newcomers which means as hackers adapt we as developers have to as well.
