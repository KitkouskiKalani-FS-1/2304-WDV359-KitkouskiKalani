## ðŸ“¢ &nbsp; Weekly Stand Up

Each week I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by writing a stand-up. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going. Use these prompts as a guide on what to write about:

### Week 1

What I did this week was add the pre-existing project to a new repo and add a resarch document, added to my portfolio and created a changelog modifying the scope of the project.

### Week 2

What I worked on this week was a research document on A/B testing, utilizing google analytics and use cases. I also worked on front-end react components during this week including my item and champion cards.

### Week 3

What I worked on this week was a research document that went over innovation and creation of a successful project. I also finished adding the rest of my react components and at this point the front end of my project is completed just not linked correctly.

### Week 4

My final stand up...
